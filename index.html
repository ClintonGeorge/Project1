        <p> Hello viewers! My name is Clinton George and I am a Sophomore at Illinois Institute of technology studying Computer Science. I am international student coming from the United Arab Emirates. I can read and write or speak five languages: English, French, Arabic, Hindi and Tamil. Before all you assume I am multi-linguistic, I am only fluent in English though I used to write essays in French few years back. I am looking forward to mastering html and the other scripting languages by the end of this course and have a website setup for my blog if I decide to make one. </p>
